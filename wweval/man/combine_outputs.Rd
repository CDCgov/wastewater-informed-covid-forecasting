\description{
This function is a helper function specific to the current nested file
stucture specified by the functions that save the quantiles and scores
for each of the model runs to disk. The function takes in the
vectors of scenarios, forecast dates, and locations with output model runs,
checks if they exist in the current file structure, and if they do
loads them in and binds them together to create one large dataframe with
all of the outputs row binded
}
