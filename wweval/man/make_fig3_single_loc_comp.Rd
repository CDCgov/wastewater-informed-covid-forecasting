to plot}

\code{horizon} that we want to show on the plot, must be a subset of
\code{nowcast}, \verb{1 wk}, \verb{2 wks},\verb{3 wks}, \verb{4 wks} and \code{overall}}
}
\value{
a ggplot object containing violin plots comparing the distribution
of crps scores across forecast dates for a single location, grouped by
horizon and colored by model
