# `cfaforecastrenewalww` package

This R package provides functions and data infrastructure for running the wastewater-informed COVID-19 hospital admissions models published on GitHub at [`cdcgov/wastewater-informed-covid-forecasting`](https://github.com/cdcgov/wastewater-informed-covid-forecasting) and submitted to the [Covid-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org/) as [`cfa-wwrenewal`](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/blob/HEAD/data-processed/cfa-wwrenewal). See that repository's [`README`](https://github.com/cdcgov/wastewater-informed-covid-forecasting/blob/HEAD/README.md) and [model definition](https://github.com/cdcgov/wastewater-informed-covid-forecasting/blob/HEAD/model_definition.md) for additional technical and mathematical details on the model.

Note that while it is installable and has some unit tests and documentation, **it is an alpha version**, not a beta or a full first release. It is built more to support our specific model-fitting use case than for general wastewater modeling, though we encourage others to adapt and generalize the codebase and to submit improvements back to us as open source contributions. We also enthusiastically encourage users to help us by filing [issues](https://github.com/cdcgov/wastewater-informed-covid-forecasting/issues) on GitHub if they run into trouble or find a bug.
